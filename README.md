#  REACT 

Repeat the main basics of React.
### Stage 1. 
  Here I'm using fundamentals of React including simple and class components, state, props, and submitting form data.

### Stage 2.
Then, add a few routers more (sign-up, sign-in and whoops404). Nevertheless, There is no databases or another serious system of authentication here.

By default the app has already had the **default account**. You can you it or create your own account

| Name        | Email         | Password  |
| ------------- |:-----------:| -----:|
| admin     | admin@gmail.com | admin  |

### Stage 3
In the conclusion, I turned on redux, react-redux and wrote necessary functions (actions, reduces) for correct  app work properly.
